# Waste resources

Wastes in TIAM-FR encompass three commodities, namely biomass industrial wastes (BIOBIN), biomass municipal wastes (BIOBMU), and non-renewable municipal wastes (MWSTNR). Due to lack of data and representativity, the avaiability and extraction potentials are not represented in TIAM-FR. The extraction costs are taken from the last version of ETSAP-TIAM with $7/GJ for BIOBIN and $6/GJ for BIOBMU a MWSTNR.
These commodities are then usable in different sectors of the economy (agriculture, commercial, electricity, industry and residential).
