# Non-energy GHG emissions

## Process CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

Process CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to limestone calcination occuring the cement process are detailed in Table 2 of the section dedicated to [cement](../../docs/energy-sectors/industry/cement/index.md).

Process CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to the oxidation of carbon occuring in steel manufacturing processes are detailed in the section dedicated to [iron & steel](../../docs/energy-sectors/industry/iron-steel/index.md), Appendix 1.

## Other non-energy GHG emissions

Other non-energy GHG emissions include CO<sub>2</sub>, CH4, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture, forestry and land-use (AFOLU), as well as process N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from adipic industry and nitric industry.
