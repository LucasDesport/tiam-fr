# Gas trades

Gas trades are calibrated in 2018 based on BP Statistic Review of World Energy (BP, 2019). Gas can be traded either through pipelines or by ships.

## Pipeline trades

According to BP (2019), pipeline trades across TIAM-FR regions are declared in 2018 following Table 1. So initial capacities of pipeline-based gas trades are limited to these observed exchanges.

Before being used in a region or country, gas should be liquified, shipped, regasified. The techno-economic propoerties of liquefaction and regasification processes are as Table 3 shows. The whole chain or liquefaction and regasification shows 10% loss.
