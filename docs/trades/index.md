# Trades

Trades are defined unilaterally between regions in TIAM-FR. Most energy trades like fossil fuels and bioenergy are represented but material commodities (e.g. steel, cement, chemical, etc.) are not considered. The assumptions for trading fossil fuels are extracted from (Remme et al., 2007) Hydrogen trades become an option as of 2030 for selected regions. Besides, in some scenarios, trading CO<sub>2</sub> permits is allowed.
