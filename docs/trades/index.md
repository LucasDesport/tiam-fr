# Trades

Trades are defined unilaterally between regions in TIAM-FR. Most energy trades like fossil fuels and bioenergy are represented but material commodities (e.g. steel, cement, chemical, etc.) are not considered. Hydrogen trades become an option as of 2030 for selected regions. Besides, in some scenarios, trading CO2 permits is allowed.
