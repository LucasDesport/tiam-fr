# CO<sub>2</sub> transport and storage

The regional CO<sub>2</sub> storage potential assumed in TIAM-FR are as Table 1 shows. They correspond to the lower estimate of Kearns et al. (2017).

CO<sub>2</sub> capture opportunities are available in TIAM-FR in the [industry sector](industry.md), [hydrogen generation](hydrogen.md), [biofuels generation](biofuels.md), [power generation](power-sector.md), and for [direct air capture](dac.md), thus delivering three types of CO<sub>2</sub> commodity: fossil, process, biogenic or atmospheric. Both biogenic and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are classified as climate-neutral CO<sub>2</sub>. In Figure 1, these commodities are respectively colored in orange, grey, and green. Dummy processes labeled generically with CCSDUM prefix aggregate all captured CO2 types into a single commodity called SNKCO2, as described in the [CO<sub>2</sub> accounting](CO2-accounting.md) section, such that any SNKCO2 generated by the dummy processes has to be eliminated in a SINK process, either onshore  (SINKON) or offshore (SINKOFF).  


Regarding the transport of CO<sub>2</sub>, there is actually no process to represent it physically. However, to eliminate the CO2 (SNKCO2), the system must pay for the transport and storage, whose cost are shown in Table 2 and assumed from Smith et al. (2021).  
To realistically model the operations of CO2 storage, we introduced a constraint on the CO2 injection rate that is consistent with the average injection rates of a well over its economic lifetime. We express this constraint as a ratio of the annual average injection rate to the total capacity of the well:
ratio of injection rate=(average injection rate [Gt/y ])/(capacity of the well [Gt])
To calculate this ratio, we used the data published by (Jahediesfanjani et al., 2018) that estimated the injection rate per well and basin, along with their storage capacity. This results in a ratio equal to 2.6% which was used as an ACT_BND constraint to the SINK processes in order to limit their annual operation with an acceptable injection rate.
Finally, we consider that the exchange of captured CO2 between countries is allowed by international regulations under the London Protocol (IEAGHG, 2021c). As some of the regions in the model are country-aggregated (e.g., WEU, AFR, CSA, etc.), it is important to assume that countries can store CO2 in a different country from where it was emitted and captured.
