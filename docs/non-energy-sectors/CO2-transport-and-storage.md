# CO<sub>2</sub> transport and storage

The regional CO<sub>2</sub> storage potential assumed in TIAM-FR are as Table 1 shows. They correspond to the lower estimate of Kearns et al. (2017).

CO<sub>2</sub> capture opportunities are available in TIAM-FR in the [industry sector](energy-sectors/industry/index.md), [hydrogen generation](energy-sectors/supply/hydrogen.md), [biofuels generation](energy-sectors/supply/biofuels.md), [power generation](energy-sectors/supply/power-sector.md), and for [direct air capture](/backstop/dac/index.md), thus delivering three types of CO<sub>2</sub> commodity: fossil, process, biogenic or atmospheric. Both biogenic and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are classified as climate-neutral CO<sub>2</sub>. In Figure 1, these commodities are respectively colored in orange, grey, and green. Dummy processes - labeled generically with CCSDUM prefix - aggregate all captured CO<sub>2</sub> types into a single commodity labeled SNKCO2, as described in the [CO<sub>2</sub> accounting](CO2-accounting.md) section, such that any SNKCO2 generated by the dummy processes is eliminated in a storage process, either onshore  (SINKON) or offshore (SINKOFF). Regarding the transport of CO<sub>2</sub>, there is actually no process to represent it physically. However, to eliminate the CO<sub>2</sub> (SNKCO2), the system must pay for the transport and storage, whose cost are shown in Table 2 and assumed from Smith et al. (2021).

To realistically model the operations of CO<sub>2</sub> storage, a constraint on the CO<sub>2</sub> injection rate limits the annual activity of CO<sub>2</sub> storage processes. This rate of 2.6% (Jahediesfanjani et al., 2018) is consistent with the average injection rates of a well over its economic lifetime
Finally, we consider that the exchange of captured CO<sub>2</sub> between countries is allowed by international regulations under the London Protocol (IEAGHG, 2021). As some of the regions in the model are country-aggregated (e.g., WEU, AFR, CSA, etc.), it is important to assume that countries can store CO<sub>2</sub> in a different country from where it was emitted and captured.
