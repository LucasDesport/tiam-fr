# Non-CO<sub>2</sub> measures

In TIAM-FR, non-CO<sub>2</sub> measures address CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from the agriculture, residential, and industrial sectors. Since most non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from these sectors are not explicitly modeled, exogenous emissions projections are sourced from the Energy Modeling Forum 21 (Rose et al., 2007). The same reference is used to characterize the techno-economic properties of specific non-CO<sub>2</sub> measures. Additionally, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from fossil fuel extraction are targeted and modeled endogenously.

## Agriculture

In agriculture, CH<sub>4</sub> measures tackle emissions manure management, biomass burning and enteric fermentation. N<sub>2</sub>O measures tackle emissions related to landfills and fertilizers. Specifically, these include various types of farm-scale digesters, as well as heat and power generation.

## Residential

In the residential sector, CH<sub>4</sub> measures specifically target emissions from waste landiflls. Specifically, these include composting, anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment, heat production, electricity generation, increased oxidation, direct gas use, and flaring.

## Industry

In industry, N<sub>2</sub>O measures tackle emissions from the adipic industry by thermal destruction measures, and those from the nitric acid industry by implemenitng low or high temperature catalytic reduction methods.

## Fossil extractions

When extracting fossil gas, oil products, or coal, CH<sub>4</sub> leakages occurs, releasing emissions into the atmosphere. To abate these emissions, TIAM-FR is equipped with several options including flaring, degasification and pipeline injection, catalytic oxidation, production of heat and electricity, use gas turbines instead of reciprocating engines, installation of flash tanks separators, replace high-bleed pneumatic devices with compressed air systems or low-bleed pneumatics, dry seals on centrifugal Compressors, or catalytic conversers.
