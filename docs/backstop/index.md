# Backstop technologies

In climate mitigation science, a "backstop technology" refers to an advanced technology that can drastically reduce or even eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, providing a final safeguard or "backstop" against the worst impacts of climate change. These technologies are often seen as last-resort solutions that could be deployed if other mitigation efforts (like renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency improvements, or behavior changes) fall short in preventing dangerous levels of global warming.
