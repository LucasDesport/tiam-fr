# CO<sub>2</sub> utilization

The technological options for CO<sub>2</sub> utilization in TIAM-FR encompasses 4 routes:
+ hydrogenation of CO<sub>2</sub> into methanol
+ methanaton of CO<sub>2</sub> into methane
+ Fischer-Tropsch process into a range of synthetic fuels
+ mineralization of CO<sub>2</sub>

For routes converting CO<sub>2</sub> into synthetic fuels, several designs are implemented depending on the nature of the CO<sub>2</sub> processed and the type of hydrogen, i.e. either generated by dedicated variable renewable assets or centralized electricity. Concerning the nature of CO2, we distinguish fossil and process CO<sub>2</sub> from biogenic and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. As hydrogen is not involved in the mineralization of CO<sub>2</sub>, only the nature of CO<sub>2</sub> processed in differentiated.

As it is assumed that 90% of the CO<sub>2</sub> processed is actually converted, residual emissions are accounted for 1% of the CO<sub>2</sub> flow in the case where fossil CO<sub>2</sub> is employed. For processes convertin CO<sub>2</sub> into synthetic fuels, capacity designs are assumed to a commercial capacity of 11.2 PJ/y (Winchester et al., 2013). All CO<sub>2</sub> utilization processes are commercially available as of 2030.

## Hydrogenation

Methanol (CH₃OH or MeOH) is an alcohol used as a fuel for transportation demands such as buses, heavy trucks, light trucks, and cars. The main process to generate methanol is to make CO<sub>2</sub> react with H<sub>2</sub>, also yielding water as a by-product:

$$
CO_2+3H_2↔CH_3 OH+H_2O
$$

The techno-economic assumptions for this processes are taken from Zhang et al. (2019) and summarized in Table 1.

|Properties|Units|Values|
|----------|-----|------|
|Hydrogen efficiency|J/J|1.08|
|CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency|g/J|75.4|
|CAPEX|$/GJpa|20|
|Fixed O&M|$/GJpa|0.7|

The techno-economic assumptions for CO2 capture can be found in sections related to [the power sector](power-sector.md), [biofuels](biofuels.md), [industry](industry.md), and [direct air capture](dac.md). The techno-economic assumptions for hydrogen supply can be found [here](hydrogen.md).  

Besides, methanol turned into gasoline through the so-called Methanol-to-Gasoline (MtG) process for which liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity are co-products. Likewise, the MtG process can employ fossil-based or climate-neutral methanol. The techno-economic assumptions for this process are extrated from Hennig and Haase (2021) and summarized in Table 2:

Tab. 2: Techno-economic properties of Methanol-to-Gasoline in TIAM-FR (Henning and Haase, 2021)
|Properties|Units|Values|
|----------|-----|------|
|Gasoline yield|J/J|0.52|
|LPG yield|J/J|0.40|
|Electricity generation|J/J|0.1|
|CAPEX|$/GW|5|
|Fixed O&M|$/GW|0.04|
|Availability factor||90%|

|Discount rate||7%|

In TIAM-FR, methanol is only modeled as an energy carrier, not as a chemical good. The energy demand for methanol as a chemical is implicitly modeled and included in the overall energy demand of the chemical industry.  

## Methanation
Methanation is a process turning CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> into synthetic CH<sub>4</sub> through the following reaction:
$$
CO_2+4H_2↔CH_4 OH+H_2O
$$

The synthetic methane can be utilized in end-use processes to substitute for natural gas. The techno-economic properties of methanation processes implemented in TIAM-FR are taken from Chauvy et al. (2021) and summarized in Table 3.

|Hydrogen input|J/J|1.2|
|Electricity consumption|J/J|0.002|
