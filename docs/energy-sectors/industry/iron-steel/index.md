# Iron & Steel

The ISI is represented as one of the six subsectors of the industry sector, namely cement, chemistry, pulp and paper, aluminum, iron and steel and the rest of the industry. The energy consumption of the modelâ€™s base year, i.e. 2018, is based on the energy balances of the steel industry from the
IEA database [54]. The demand satisfied by the model is described in terms of tons of materials based on [4]. As a result, each region has a certain energy efficiency that converts the energy used into tons of steel, depending on the efficiency of the existing assets in 2018. Steel demand is projected over
the 21st century based on the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Indeed, the quantity of steel produced by a country has been proven to be a function of this socio-economic driver [55, 56]. Regarding the projection of GDP per capita, these statistics are extracted from the IIASA SSP database [57]. The database enables us to calculate the elasticity of final energy
demand of the industry to GDP per capita. Assuming an SSP2-2.6, the demand for steel is estimated to increase from 1.8 Mt in 2018 to 2.4 Mt in 2050 and decrease to 2.1 Mt in 2100.
