# Biofuels

Biofuels denote end-use fuels made out of transformed [biomass](\resources\biomass.md) products. In TIAM-FR, biofuels encompass biodiesel, bioethanol, biogasoline, biogas, biomethane, and biochar. Two main references are used here, that is, a report by (IEAGHG, 2021b), on which most of the data is based on, and a report by (IEA Bioenergy, 2019), which gives information on second-generation fermentation processes (without CCS).

## Biodiesel and bioethanol

Table 1 and Table 2 display the technoeconomic characteristics of the processes biodiesel and bioethanol in TIAM-FR.
The processes can be divided into two categories: biodiesel refineries and bioethanol refineries, fed with different types of biomass, whose global potentials and harvesting costs were established by (Kang, 2017). The biodiesel plants either work with a fast pyrolysis (FP) process or a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. In the cases when a CO<sub>2</sub> capture unit is set up, the efficiency can be improved to its maximum (see MAX label), hence the specification in the first columns of Table 2.

Biodiesel can be used in any sectors bu bioethanol and only be used in the transport sector for mitigating emissions of all road end-uses.

## Biogasoline

A single process produces biogasoline through pyrolysis of ligno-cellulosic biomass. Table 3 shows the techno-economic assumptions of the process modeled in (Kang, 2017) thesis.

Biogasoline can subsequently used to decarbonize all sectors of the economy.

## Biogas and biomethane

Biogas and biomethane are both renewable energy sources derived from organic matter, but they differ in their composition, production processes, and applications. Biomethane is distinguished from biogas as a perfect substitute to fossil methane - or natural gas. In TIAM-FR, biogas can be produced through anaerobic digestion of crops and agricultural residues, and then upgraded in biomethane through a cleaning process. Second generation biomass gasification process also enable to directly transform biomass into biomethane either through a circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFB) or a fast internal circulation fluidized bed reactor (FICFB). The techno-economics are taken from (Kang, 2017)..

Biogas can be used in all sectors of the economy but is not a perfect substitute to natural gas.

## Biochar

Biochar is a type of charcoal that is produced by pyrolyzing organic materials (such as agricultural waste, wood chips, and plant residues) in the absence of oxygen at high temperatures (usually between 300°C and 600°C). This results in a stable, carbon-rich product that can be used as an energy commodity of a fertilizer. In TIAM-FR, biochar is only represented as an energy commodity made out of wood chips or harvest residues. In the first case, the production cost is estimated to 4.63 $/GJ (Cristobal Feliciano-Bruzual 2014) in addition to the cost of processing wood chips. In the second case, the production cost is estimated to $32/GJ plus the cost of processing agricultural residued (Nematian et al., 2021). In both cases, the energy efficiency is estimated to 65% based on (Cristobal Feliciano-Bruzual, 2014)
