# Optimization

Linear programming is formulated in the GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System) language and solved with the linear programming optimizer CPLEX, by 
minimizing the total discounted cost of the energy system. 


For an exhaustive and comprehensive description of optimization problems in TIMES models, please consult the [ETSAP documentation](https://github.com/etsap-TIMES/TIMES_Documentation/blob/master/Documentation_for_the_TIMES_Model-Part-II.pdf).
